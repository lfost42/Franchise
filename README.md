# Franchise Planner

An exercise in geolocation, csv parsing, and logging. A franchise owner must determine the locations that are furthest apart so they may strategize the building of new locations in the area.

## Overview

This project culminates the C# segment of the Software Engineering course at True Coders (https://truecoders.io). 

The coding challenge was to use a csv file of approximately 300 Taco Bell locations and determine which two are furthest apart from one another. 

## Experiments

I've since removed redundancies, decoupled dependancies, and converted the project to conform to DAO pattern. A Class Library is implemented to segregate the data from the user interface. 

I plan to convert this into a web application in the near future with an API to process the algorithm after removing each of the results from the dataset and export the results to a csv file.
