# Road Trip Planner

An exercise in geolocation, csv parsing, and logging. The main logic is present from a previous assignment. Future plans are below.

## Overview

This project culminates the C# segment of the Software Engineering course at True Coders (https://truecoders.io). 
The coding challenge was to use a csv file of approximately 300 Taco Bell locations and determine which two are furthest
apart from one another. 

## Experiments

I've since removed redunancies and converted the project to conform to DAO architecture. 

## Plans

1. Convert to web application.
2. Utilize a mapping API to allow users to select two locations and have all Taco Bell locations between the two points filtered and mapped.
